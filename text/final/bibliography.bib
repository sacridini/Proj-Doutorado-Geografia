The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact, created in 2009 as a movement to restore 15Mha of degraded/deforested lands by 2050, pledged 1Mha towards the 2020 Bonn Challenge. We documented the restoration of an estimated 673,510–740,555ha of native forests from 2011 to 2015 in the Atlantic Forest, and expect that a total of 1.35–1.48Mha will be under recovery by 2020. The Pact is one of the first Brazilian restoration initiatives to monitor an international restoration commitment and to demonstrate that ambitious targets can be reached. Part of this success in large-scale restoration is related to three main Pact activities: (i) development of restoration governance, communication and articulation; (ii) promotion of strategies to influence public policies; and (iii) establishment of restoration monitoring systems. The experience and lessons learned by the Pact could inspire and inform other restoration initiatives worldwide."

abstract = "Assessing the performance of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires data on forest cover change. Innovations in remote sensing and forest monitoring provide ever-increasing levels of coverage, spatial and temporal detail, and accuracy. More global products and advanced open-source algorithms are becoming available. Still, these datasets and tools are not always consistent or complementary, and their suitability for local REDD+ performance assessments remains unclear. These assessments should, ideally, be free of any confounding factors, but performance estimates are affected by data uncertainties in unknown ways. Here, we analyse (1) differences in accuracy between datasets of forest cover change; (2) if and how combinations of datasets can increase accuracy; and we demonstrate (3) the effect of (not) doing accuracy assessments for REDD+ performance measurements. Our study covers five local REDD+ initiatives in four countries across the tropics. We compared accuracies of a readily available global forest cover change dataset and a locally modifiable open-source break detection algorithm. We applied human interpretation validation tools using Landsat Time Series data and high-resolution optical imagery. Next, we assessed whether and how combining different datasets can increase accuracies using several combination strategies. Finally, we demonstrated the consequences of using the input datasets for REDD+ performance assessments with and without considering their accuracies and uncertainties. Estimating the amount of deforestation using validation samples could substantially reduce uncertainty in REDD+ performance assessments. We found that the accuracies of the various data sources differ at site level, although on average neither one of the input products consistently excelled in accuracy. Using a combination of both products as stratification for area estimation and validated with a sample of high-resolution data seems promising. In these combined products, the expected trade-offs in accuracies across change classes (before, after, no change) and across accuracy types (user’s and producer’s accuracy) were negligible, so their use is advantageous over single-source datasets. More locally calibrated wall-to-wall products should be developed to make them more useful and applicable for REDD+ purposes. The direction and degree of REDD+ performance remained statistically uncertain, as CIs were overlapping in most cases for the deforestation estimates before and after the start of the REDD+ interventions. Given these uncertainties and inaccuracies and to increase the credibility of REDD+ it is advised to (1) be conservative in REDD+ accounting, and (2) not to rely on results from single currently available global data sources or tools without sample-based validation if results-based payments are intended to be made on this basis."

abstract = "A wealth of remotely sensed image time series covering large areas is now available to the earth science community. Change detection methods are often not capable of detecting land cover changes within time series that are heavily influenced by seasonal climatic variations. Detecting change within the trend and seasonal components of time series enables the classification of different types of changes. Changes occurring in the trend component often indicate disturbances (e.g. fires, insect attacks), while changes occurring in the seasonal component indicate phenological changes (e.g. change in land cover type). A generic change detection approach is proposed for time series by detecting and characterizing Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change within time series. BFAST iteratively estimates the time and number of changes, and characterizes change by its magnitude and direction. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonality and noise, and by adding abrupt changes at different times and magnitudes. This revealed that BFAST can robustly detect change with different magnitudes (>0.1 NDVI) within time series with different noise levels (0.01–0.07 σ) and seasonal amplitudes (0.1–0.5 NDVI). Additionally, BFAST was applied to 16-day NDVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composites for a forested study area in south eastern Australia. This showed that BFAST is able to detect and characterize spatial and temporal changes in a forested landscape. BFAST is not specific to a particular data type and can be applied to time series without the need to normalize for land cover types, select a reference period, or change trajectory. The method can be integrated within monitoring frameworks and used as an alarm system to flag when and where changes occur."

abstract = "A challenge in phenology studies is understanding what constitutes phenological change amidst background variation. The majority of phenological studies have focused on extracting critical points in the seasonal growth cycle, without exploiting the full temporal detail. The high degree of phenological variability between years demonstrates the necessity of distinguishing long-term phenological change from temporal variability. Here, we demonstrate the phenological change detection ability of a method for detecting change within time series. BFAST, Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend, integrates the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for detecting change. We tested BFAST by simulating 16-day NDVI time series with varying amounts of seasonal amplitude and noise, containing abrupt disturbances (e.g. fires) and long-term phenological changes. This revealed that the method is able to detect the timing of phenological changes within time series while accounting for abrupt disturbances and noise. Results showed that the phenological change detection is influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the time series. Between different land cover types the seasonal amplitude varies and determines the signal-to-noise ratio, and as such the capacity to differentiate phenological changes from noise. Application of the method on 16-day NDVI MODIS images from 2000 until 2009 for a forested study area in south eastern Australia confirmed these results. It was shown that a minimum seasonal amplitude of 0.1 NDVI is required to detect phenological change within cleaned MODIS NDVI time series using the quality flags. BFAST identifies phenological change independent of phenological metrics by exploiting the full time series. The method is globally applicable since it analyzes each pixel individually without the setting of thresholds to detect change within a time series. Long-term phenological changes can be detected within NDVI time series of a large range of land cover types (e.g. grassland, woodlands and deciduous forests) having a seasonal amplitude larger than the noise level. The method can be applied to any time series data and it is not necessarily limited to NDVI."

Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/)."

The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984–2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond."

    abstract = {Shifting cultivation is the main land-use system transforming landscapes in riverine Amazonia. Increased concentration of the human population around villages and increasing market integration during the last decades may be causing agricultural intensification. Studies have shown that agricultural intensification, i.e. higher number of swidden-fallow cycles and shorter fallow periods, reduces crop productivity of swiddens and the regrowth capacity of fallows, undermining the resilience of the shifting cultivation system as a whole. We investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of shifting cultivation in Brazilian Amazonia to test the hypotheses that (i) agriculture has become more intensive over time, and (ii) patterns of land-use intensity are related to land accessibility and human population density. We applied a breakpoint-detection algorithm to Landsat time-series spanning three decades (1984–2015) and retrieved the temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation fields, which go through alternating phases of crop production (swidden) and secondary forest regrowth (fallow). We found that fallow-period length has decreased from 6.4 to 5.1 years on average, and that expansion over old-growth forest has slowed down over time. Shorter fallow periods and higher frequency of slash and burn cycles are practiced closer to residences and around larger villages. Our results indicate that shifting cultivation in riverine Amazonia has gone through a process of agricultural intensification in the past three decades. The resulting landscape is predominantly covered by young secondary forests (≤ 12 yrs old), and 20% of it have gone through intensive use. Reversing this trend and avoiding the negative consequences of agricultural intensification requires land use planning that accounts for the constraints of land use in riverine areas.},

	abstract = {Accurate and precise measures of tropical deforestation and the resulting carbon emissions are needed in order to formulate climate policy. Harris et al. (p. 1573; see the Perspective by Zarin) used satellite observations of deforestation within the tropics of three continents to estimate that gross annual carbon emissions were approximately 0.8 Pg Cyr-2 (Pg = 1015 g) for the years 2000 to 2005, from the loss of 43 million hectares of forest. This result, which is about one-third of some previous estimates, should serve as a baseline for future assessments of changes in the rate of loss of tropical forests.Policies to reduce emissions from deforestation would benefit from clearly derived, spatially explicit, statistically bounded estimates of carbon emissions. Existing efforts derive carbon impacts of land-use change using broad assumptions, unreliable data, or both. We improve on this approach using satellite observations of gross forest cover loss and a map of forest carbon stocks to estimate gross carbon emissions across tropical regions between 2000 and 2005 as 0.81 petagram of carbon per year, with a 90\% prediction interval of 0.57 to 1.22 petagrams of carbon per year. This estimate is 25 to 50\% of recently published estimates. By systematically matching areas of forest loss with their carbon stocks before clearing, these results serve as a more accurate benchmark for monitoring global progress on reducing emissions from deforestation.},

Here, we attempt to construct a ‘bottom-up’ analysis of the biological components of the budget as they are affected by human activities. There are major uncertainties in the extent and carbon content of different vegetation types, the rates of land-use change and forest degradation, but recent developments in satellite remote sensing have gone far towards reducing these uncertainties. Stocks of carbon as biomass in tropical forests and woodlands add up to 271 ± 16 Pg with an even greater quantity of carbon as soil organic matter. Carbon loss from deforestation, degradation, harvesting and peat fires is estimated as 2.01 ± 1.1 Pg annum−1; while carbon gain from forest and woodland growth is 1.85 ± 0.09 Pg annum−1. We conclude that tropical lands are on average a small carbon source to the atmosphere, a result that is consistent with the ‘top-down’ result from measurements in the atmosphere. If they were to be conserved, they would be a substantial carbon sink. Release of carbon as carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning in the tropics is 0.74 Pg annum−1 or 0.57 MgC person−1 annum−1, much lower than the corresponding figures from developed regions of the world.},

Next, a normalized temperature probability, spectral variability probability, and brightness probability are combined to produce a probability mask for clouds over land and water separately. Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4%. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images."

abstract = "Identification of clouds, cloud shadows and snow in optical images is often a necessary step toward their use. Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4–7 (Zhu & Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4–7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4–7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4–7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds. Landsat 8 results are better than the Sentinel 2 scenario, with 6 out of 7 test images showing higher accuracies."

However, few of the proposed methods for remote sensing time series analysis are available as open source software. In this paper we present the R package dtwSat. This package provides an implementation of the time-weighted dynamic time warping method for land cover mapping using sequence of multi-band satellite images. Methods based on dynamic time warping are flexible to handle irregular sampling and out-of-phase time series, and they have achieved significant results in time series analysis. Package dtwSat is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contributes to making methods for satellite time series analysis available to a larger audience. The package supports the full cycle of land cover classification using image time series, ranging from selecting temporal patterns to visualizing and assessing the results.},

Here, we describe and test a new conceptual approach to change detection of forests using a dense temporal stack of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. The central premise of the method is the recognition that many phenomena associated with changes in land cover have distinctive temporal progressions both before and after the change event, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in spectral space. Rather than search for single change events between two dates of imagery, we instead search for these idealized signatures in the entire temporal trajectory of spectral values. This trajectory-based change detection is automated, requires no screening of non-forest area, and requires no metric-specific threshold development. Moreover, the method simultaneously provides estimates of discontinuous phenomena (disturbance date and intensity) as well as continuous phenomena (post-disturbance regeneration). We applied the method to a stack of 18 Landsat TM images for the 20-year period from 1984 to 2004. When compared with direct interpreter delineation of disturbance events, the automated method accurately labeled year of disturbance with 90% overall accuracy in clear-cuts and with 77% accuracy in partial-cuts (thinnings). The primary source of error in the method was misregistration of images in the stack, suggesting that higher accuracies are possible with better registration."

Time-series analysis of MODIS satellite data of selectively logged forests in Mato Grosso, Brazil, shows that relatively low levels (5–10%) of canopy damage cause significant and long-lasting (more than 30years) changes in forest phenology. Partial clearing slows forest green-up in the dry season, progressively dries the canopy, and induces overall seasonal deficits in canopy moisture and greenness. Given large and increasing geographic extent of selective logging throughout Amazonia, this phenological disturbance has a potential to impact carbon and water fluxes, nutrient dynamics, and other functional processes in these forests."

abstract = "We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robust means of increasing information extraction from the Landsat archive."

We developed approaches to create disturbance and regrowth maps for forests within the area of the NWFP from the results of LandTrendr, a temporal segmentation algorithm described previously only at the pixel scale. Maps were developed from 674 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ images distributed across 22 separate scene areas, and were assessed for validity at 2360 points using TimeSync, a time-series validation and interpretation tool. Unlike maps derived using other techniques, maps derived from the segmentation approach were unique in providing simultaneous detection of abrupt disturbance, chronic disturbance, and ongoing vegetative growth with consistency across large areas and across time. Maps were then used to address six core monitoring questions focusing on the distribution of disturbance across time, ownership categories, and ecoregions. Forest was disturbed at rates that varied by ownership category and state, ranging from 9\% to >39\% of forest area over the period 1985 to 2008, with highest cumulative disturbed area on private and native lands in Washington and Oregon and lowest disturbed area on federal protected lands in Washington. Effects of court injunctions and subsequent implementation of the NWFP lowered forest disturbance rates, particularly in Oregon, and also caused decreases in the relative magnitude of disturbance on those lands relative to private lands. State-managed forests showed forest disturbance rates that varied considerably among the three states, with the highest rates in Washington state and lowest in California. Affected by large, stochastic fire events, protected lands in both Oregon and California showed disturbance rates similar to those found on actively managed federal lands. Protected lands also experienced high rates of chronic disturbance, often associated with insect-related mortality. As expected, moisture-limited ecoregions recovered vegetation more slowly than those where moisture was not limiting. Vegetative regrowth rates showed substantial variation among ownership categories, suggesting that differential forest policies may affect vegetative recovery rate. Taken together, these results emphasize that forest management policies do have manifestations at the landscape scale, but that detection of these manifestations is best achieved with mapping approaches that can detect both abrupt and longer-duration processes within the Landsat archive."

Conversely, Landsat data are more widely available, but exhibit a weaker relationship with structure under medium to high leaf area conditions. One potentially valuable means of enhancing the relationship between Landsat reflectance and forest structure is to incorporate Landsat spectral trends prior to a date of interest. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is linked to the stand's disturbance history, an approach that directly leverages the temporal information of Landsat time series should improve estimates of forest structure. The main objective of this study was to test and demonstrate the utility of disturbance and recovery metrics derived from spectral profiles of annual Landsat time series (LTS) to predict current forest structure attributes (as compared to more traditional approaches, including airborne, discrete return lidar and single-date Landsat). We estimated aboveground live biomass (AGBlive), dead woody biomass (AGBdead), basal area (live and dead), and Lorey's mean stand height for a mixed-conifer forest in eastern Oregon, USA, and compared the results with estimates from lidar and single, current-date Landsat imagery. Annual time-series stacks for the entire Landsat record (1972–2010) were obtained to characterize all long-term (insect, growth) and short-term (fire, harvest) vegetation changes that occurred during that period. This required the additional objective of integrating Landsat data from MSS and TM/ETM+sensors, and we describe here our approach. To extract spectral trajectories and change metrics associated with forest disturbances and recovery we applied a temporal segmentation to the calibrated time series. Lidar predicted forest structure of live trees most accurately (e.g. AGBlive: R2=0.88, RMSE=35.3Mgha−1). However, LTS metrics significantly improved model predictions (e.g. AGBlive: R2=0.80, RMSE=46.9Mgha−1) compared to single-date Landsat data (AGBlive, R2=0.58, RMSE=65.1Mgha−1). Conversely, distributions of AGBdead were more strongly associated with disturbance history than current structure of live trees. As a result, LTS models performed significantly better in estimating AGBdead (R2=0.73, RMSE=31.0Mgha−1), than lidar models (R2=0.21, RMSE=43.8Mgha−1); and single-date Landsat data failed completely (R2=0, RMSE=47.8Mgha−1). Further, LTS metrics that integrated disturbance and recovery history over the entire time series generally predicted AGBdead better than metrics describing single events only (e.g. the greatest disturbance). This study demonstrates the unique value of the long, historic Landsat record, and suggests new potentials for mapping current forest structure with Landsat."

It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating “noisy” observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98\% and user's accuracies of 86\% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80\%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90\%."

This algorithm is based on the spectral–temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2–3h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80\% were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user's and producer's accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70\% and 60\% in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with no-change classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations."

The NAFD project is evaluating forest disturbance patterns and rates of disturbance by integrating U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field observations with temporally dense time series Landsat imagery. In Phase I of NAFD forest disturbance history was derived for 23 U.S. sample locations over the time period 1984 to 2005 from biennial Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This study evaluates the accuracy of these Phase I NAFD disturbance history maps for 6 selected sample locations. We evaluate the disturbance maps using 2 reference datasets: 1) a design-based approach incorporating visual analysis of the LTSS in tandem with high resolution imagery and 2) the USDA FIA field observations. Overall accuracy for the NAFD disturbance product assessed at the individual time step level range from 77% to 86%. We examine the success rates of the mapping approach for capturing different types of disturbance and find that 82% of stand clearing events were detected. When we aggregate the data into change and no change categories the accuracy of stand clearing disturbance samples improved to over 92%. The majority of error in the disturbance maps was due to misclassification of partial disturbance as unchanged forest. We analyze the resulting errors of commission and omission as related to both reference datasets for each LTSS and present examples to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of Phase I NAFD approach. In addition, we discuss the map biases observed in this work and what this may imply for estimating national forest disturbance rates with this approach."

abstract = "The importance of characterizing, quantifying, and monitoring land cover, land use, and their changes has been widely recognized by global and environmental change studies. Since the early 1990s, three U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products (circa 1992, 2001, and 2006) have been released as free downloads for users. The NLCD 2006 also provides land cover change products between 2001 and 2006. To continue providing updated national land cover and change datasets, a new initiative in developing NLCD 2011 is currently underway. We present a new Comprehensive Change Detection Method (CCDM) designed as a key component for the development of NLCD 2011 and the research results from two exemplar studies. The CCDM integrates spectral-based change detection algorithms including a Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) model and a novel change model called Zone, which extracts change information from two Landsat image pairs. The MIICA model is the core module of the change detection strategy and uses four spectral indices (CV, RCVMAX, dNBR, and dNDVI) to obtain the changes that occurred between two image dates. The CCDM also includes a knowledge-based system, which uses critical information on historical and current land cover conditions and trends and the likelihood of land cover change, to combine the changes from MIICA and Zone. For NLCD 2011, the improved and enhanced change products obtained from the CCDM provide critical information on location, magnitude, and direction of potential change areas and serve as a basis for further characterizing land cover changes for the nation. An accuracy assessment from the two study areas show 100% agreement between CCDM mapped no-change class with reference dataset, and 18% and 82% disagreement for the change class for WRS path/row p22r39 and p33r33, respectively. The strength of the CCDM is that the method is simple, easy to operate, widely applicable, and capable of capturing a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances potentially associated with land cover changes on different landscapes."

ABSTRACT = {In the species-rich and structurally complex forests of the Eastern United States, disturbance events are often partial and therefore difficult to detect using remote sensing methods. Here we present a set of new algorithms, collectively called Vegetation Regeneration and Disturbance Estimates through Time (VeRDET), which employ a novel patch-based approach to detect periods of vegetation disturbance, stability, and growth from the historical Landsat image records. VeRDET generates a yearly clear-sky composite from satellite imagery, calculates a spectral vegetation index for each pixel in that composite, spatially segments the vegetation index image into patches, temporally divides the time series into differently sloped segments, and then labels those segments as disturbed, stable, or regenerating. Segmentation at both the spatial and temporal steps are performed using total variation regularization, an algorithm originally designed for signal denoising. This study explores VeRDET’s effectiveness in detecting forest change using four vegetation indices and two parameters controlling the spatial and temporal scales of segmentation within a calibration region. We then evaluate algorithm effectiveness within a 386,000 km2 area in the Eastern United States where VeRDET has overall error of 23% and omission error across disturbances ranging from 22% to 78% depending on agent.},

Time series data stacks were generated for four study areas: (1) a four scene area dominated by forest and rangeland ecosystems in the southwestern United States, (2) a sagebrush-dominated rangeland in Wyoming, (3) woodland adjacent to prairie in northwestern Nebraska, and (4) a forested area in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Through analyses of time series data, we found evidence of gradual systematic change in many of the natural vegetation communities in all four areas. Many of the conifer forests in the southwestern US are showing declines related to insects and drought, but very few are showing evidence of improving conditions or increased greenness. Sagebrush communities are showing decreases in greenness related to fire, mining, and probably drought, but very few of these communities are showing evidence of increased greenness or improving conditions. In Nebraska, forest communities are showing local expansion and increased canopy densification in the prairie–woodland interface, and in the White Mountains high elevation understory conifers are showing range increases towards lower elevations. The trends detected are not obvious through casual inspection of the Landsat images. Analyses of time series data using many scenes and covering multiple years are required in order to develop better impressions and representations of the changing ecosystem patterns and trends that are occurring. The approach described in this paper demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be used operationally for assessing gradual ecosystem change across large areas. Local knowledge and available ancillary data are required in order to fully understand the nature of these trends."

For each pixel and spectral band or index of choice in temporal Landsat data, our method delivers a smoothed rendition of the trajectory constrained to behave in an ecologically sensible manner, reflecting one of seven possible ‘shapes’. It also provides parameters summarizing the patterns of each change including year of onset, duration, magnitude, and pre- and postchange rates of growth or recovery. Through a case study featuring fire, harvest, and bark beetle outbreak, we illustrate how resultant fitted values and parameters can be fed into empirical models to map disturbance causal agent and tree canopy cover changes coincident with disturbance events through time. We provide our code in the r package ShapeSelectForest on the Comprehensive R Archival Network and describe our computational approaches for running the method over large geographic areas. We also discuss how this methodology is currently being used for forest disturbance and attribute mapping across the conterminous United States.},

abstract = "Availability of free, high quality Landsat data portends a new era in remote sensing change detection. Using dense (~annual) Landsat time series (LTS), we can now characterize vegetation change over large areas at an annual time step and at the spatial grain of anthropogenic disturbance. Additionally, we expect more accurate detection of subtle disturbances and improved characterization in terms of both timing and intensity. For Landsat change detection in this new era of dense LTS, new detection algorithms are required, and new approaches are needed to calibrate those algorithms and to examine the veracity of their output. This paper addresses that need by presenting a new tool called TimeSync for syncing algorithm and human interpretations of LTS. The tool consists of four components: (1) a chip window within which an area of user-defined size around an area of interest (i.e., plot) is displayed as a time series of image chips which are viewed simultaneously, (2) a trajectory window within which the plot spectral properties are displayed as a trajectory of Landsat band reflectance or index through time in any band or index desired, (3) a Google Earth window where a recent high-resolution image of the plot and its neighborhood can be viewed for context, and (4) an Access database where observations about the LTS for the plot of interest are entered. In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington, USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). For any given plot, both TimeSync and LandTrendr partitioned its spectral trajectory into linear sequential segments. Depending on the direction of spectral change associated with any given segment in a trajectory, the segment was assigned a label of disturbance, recovery, or stable. Each segment was associated with a start and end vertex which describe its duration. We explore a variety of ways to summarize the trajectory data and compare those summaries derived from both TimeSync and LandTrendr. One comparison, involving start vertex date and segment label, provides a direct linkage to existing change detection validation approaches that rely on contingency (error) matrices and kappa statistics. All other comparisons are unique to this study, and provide a rich set of means by which to examine algorithm veracity. One of the strengths of TimeSync is its flexibility with respect to sample design, particularly the ability to sample an area of interest with statistical validity through space and time. This is in comparison to the use of existing reference data (e.g., field or airphoto data), which, at best, exist for only parts of the area of interest, for only specific time periods, or are restricted thematically. The extant data, even though biased in their representation, can be used to ascertain the veracity of TimeSync interpretation of change. We demonstrate that process here, learning that what we cannot see with TimeSync are those changes that are not expressed in the forest canopy (e.g., pre-commercial harvest or understory burning) and that these extant reference datasets have numerous omissions that render them less than desirable for representing truth."

abstract = "A new algorithm for generating synthetic Landsat images is developed based on all available Landsat data. This algorithm is capable of predicting Landsat surface reflectance for any desired date. It first excludes cloud, cloud shadow, and snow observations, and then uses the remaining clear observations to estimate time series models for each Landsat pixel. Three time series models (a simple model, advanced model, and full model) are used for estimating surface reflectance for each pixel, and the selection of a time series model is dependent on the number of clear observations available: the more clear observations, the more complex the model will be that is used. For each time series model there are three components (seasonality, trend, and breaks), that are used for modeling intra-annual and inter-annual differences and abrupt surface change. Abrupt surface changes are detected by differencing predicted and observed Landsat observations, and if the difference is larger than twice the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for six consecutive observations, it will be detected as a “break” in the time series model. The RMSE values are temporally adjusted to provide better threshold range. For each “synthetic” image, a Quality Assessment (QA) Band is provided that contains information on how the time series model was estimated and used for generating the synthetic data. We have applied this approach to six Landsat scenes within the United States. We visually compared the synthetic images with real Landsat images for different kinds of environments and they are similar for all image pairs. We also quantitatively assessed the accuracy of the synthetic data by calculating the RMSE value for all clear Landsat observations. The RMSE values for the three visible bands are the lowest (approximately 0.01), and the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are slightly higher in magnitude (between 0.01 and 0.02). The Near Infrared (NIR) band has the highest RMSE values (between 0.02 and 0.03). The goal of this paper is to provide Landsat images that are free of cloud, cloud shadow, snow, and Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off gaps that can be used to derive land cover and bio-physical products."

ABSTRACT = {The LandTrendr (LT) algorithm has been used widely for analysis of change in Landsat spectral time series data, but requires significant pre-processing, data management, and computational resources, and is only accessible to the community in a proprietary programming language (IDL). Here, we introduce LT for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE platform simplifies pre-processing steps, allowing focus on the translation of the core temporal segmentation algorithm. Temporal segmentation involved a series of repeated random access calls to each pixel&rsquo;s time series, resulting in a set of breakpoints (&ldquo;vertices&rdquo;) that bound straight-line segments. The translation of the algorithm into GEE included both transliteration and code analysis, resulting in improvement and logic error fixes. At six study areas representing diverse land cover types across the U.S., we conducted a direct comparison of the new LT-GEE code against the heritage code (LT-IDL). The algorithms agreed in most cases, and where disagreements occurred, they were largely attributable to logic error fixes in the code translation process. The practical impact of these changes is minimal, as shown by an example of forest disturbance mapping. We conclude that the LT-GEE algorithm represents a faithful translation of the LT code into a platform easily accessible by the broader user community.},

abstract = "In light of Earth's changing climate and growing human population, there is an urgent need to improve monitoring of natural and anthropogenic disturbances which effect forests' ability to sequester carbon and provide other ecosystem services. In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one. Out of bag (OOB) predictions from RF showed that across the ten scenes, overall agreement was highest when only causal agent was considered (avg=80\%, min=69\%, max=86\%), and was lowest when both agent and year (within ±1 of the reference date) were required to be correct (avg=71\%, min=56\%, max=80\%). Across scene omission and commission errors for fire and stable forest classes were mostly around 10\% to 20\%, respectively. Harvests were also modeled well, as five of nine test scenes had error rates <26\%. Accuracy of the wind and stress classes were much more variable with model errors ranging from 24\% to 88\%. The years assigned by the rule-based model were reasonably accurate, as 88\% of all disturbances were assigned a year that fell within ±2years of the reference date. Fire disturbances were assigned the correct year 78\% of the time, followed by harvest (69\%) and conversion (54\%). Although 17\% and 63\% of wind and stress disturbances were under-estimated by 5 or more years, the impact on overall accuracy was nominal given these two classes only accounted for roughly 5\% of all disturbances. Our results also revealed that causal agent models summarized to broader disturbed/not disturbed classes were as accurate as models specifically constructed to predict binary disturbance, thus there appears to be no advantage to modeling disturbance prior to assigning causality. A relative evaluation of mean decrease in accuracy from RF showed that although a wide range of predictor variables contributed to the successful modeling of causal agents and stable forest (e.g. patch metrics, forest occurrence, and topography), disturbance variables (e.g. MTBS) and spectral change metrics (e.g. absolute and relative magnitude) were by far the most important. Modeled causality maps and annual disturbance rates were examined and found to be in good agreement with existing literature and other published data sets. Lastly, results are used to make recommendations for mapping forest disturbance agents nationally across the U.S."

For example, there are several viable but highly varied strategies for using time series of Landsat imagery to detect changes in forest cover. Performance among algorithms varies across complex natural systems, and it is reasonable to ask if aggregating the strengths of an ensemble of classifiers might result in increased overall accuracy. Relatively simple rules have been used in the past to aggregate classifications among remotely sensed maps (e.g. using majority predictions), and in other fields, empirical models have been used to create situationally specific algorithm weights. The latter process, called “stacked generalization” (or “stacking”), typically uses a parametric model for the fusion of algorithm outputs. We tested the performance of several leading forest disturbance detection algorithms against ensembles of the outputs of those same algorithms based upon stacking using both parametric and Random Forests-based fusion rules. Stacking using a Random Forests model cut omission and commission error rates in half in many cases in relation to individual change detection algorithms, and cut error rates by one quarter compared to more conventional parametric stacking. Stacking also offers two auxiliary benefits: alignment of outputs to the precise definitions built into a particular set of empirical calibration data; and, outputs which may be adjusted such that map class totals match independent estimates of change in each year. In general, ensemble predictions improve when new inputs are added that are both informative and uncorrelated with existing ensemble components. As increased use of cloud-based computing makes ensemble mapping methods more accessible, the most useful new algorithms may be those that specialize in providing spectral, temporal, or thematic information not already available through members of existing ensembles."

The algorithms included are based on fundamentally different approaches to change detection and therefore offer unique advantages. The ensemble, or the combination of the three algorithms, was applied to 3 Landsat scenes in the United States and the results were assessed based on their ability to correctly discern structural breaks from stable time periods. The CUSUM test was shown to detect significant breaks 84.18\% of the time and the Chow Test correctly removed breaks in 87.4\% of the breaks analyzed. The ensemble produced results with lower frequency of errors of omission and commission (Type-I and Type-II errors) than a single algorithm approach.

abstract = "Tropical disturbed forests play an important role in global carbon sequestration due to their rapid post-disturbance biomass accumulation rates. However, the accurate estimation of the carbon sequestration capacity of disturbed forests is still challenging due to large uncertainties in their spatial distribution. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), we developed a novel approach to map cumulative disturbed forest areas based on the 27-year time-series of Landsat surface reflectance imagery. This approach integrates single date features with temporal characteristics from six time-series trajectories (two Landsat shortwave infrared bands and four vegetation indices) using a random forest machine learning classification algorithm. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method to map disturbed forests in three different forest ecoregions (seasonal, moist and dry forest) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and found that the overall mapping accuracy was high, ranging from 81.3\% for moist forest to 86.1\% for seasonal forest. According to our classification, dry forest ecoregion experienced the most severe disturbances with 41\% of forests being disturbed by 2010, followed by seasonal forest and moist forest ecoregions. We further separated disturbed forests into degraded old-growth forests and post-deforestation regrowth forests based on an existing post-deforestation land use map (TerraClass) and found that the area of degraded old-growth forests was up to 62\% larger than the extent of post-deforestation regrowth forests, with 18\% of old-growth forests actually being degraded. Application of this new classification approach to other tropical areas will provide a better constraint on the spatial extent of disturbed forest areas in Tropics and ultimately towards a better understanding of their importance in the global carbon cycle."

Monitoring restoration outcomes at this scale requires cost-effective methods to quantify not only forest cover, but also forest structure and the diversity of useful species. Here we obtain and analyze structural attributes of forest canopies undergoing restoration in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil using a portable ground lidar remote sensing device as a proxy for airborne laser scanners. We assess the ability of these attributes to distinguish forest cover types, to estimate aboveground dry woody biomass (AGB) and to estimate tree species diversity (Shannon index and richness). A set of six canopy structure attributes were able to classify five cover types with an overall accuracy of 75\%, increasing to 87\% when combining two secondary forest classes. Canopy height and the unprecedented “leaf area height volume” (a cumulative product of canopy height and vegetation density) were good predictors of AGB. An index based on the height and evenness of the leaf area density profile was weakly related to the Shannon Index of tree species diversity and showed no relationship to species richness or to change in species composition. These findings illustrate the potential and limitations of lidar remote sensing for monitoring compliance of FLR goals of landscape multifunctionality, beyond a simple assessment of forest cover gain and loss."

This close interaction is likely to increase with the embeddedness of computers and concomitant growth of spatially referenced data. To better understand the current situation, and to be able to better speculate about the future, this article provides two parallel perspectives: first, we offer an historical perspective on the relationship between Geography and computers; second, we document developments—in particular the nascent field of data science—that are currently taking place outside of Geography and to which we argue the discipline should be paying close attention. Combining both perspectives, we identify the benefits of tighter integration between Geography and Data Science and argue for the establishment of a new space—that we term Geographic Data Science—in which cross-pollination could occur to the benefit of both Geography and the larger data community.},

@article{Cohen2020,
abstract = {Disturbance monitoring is an important application of the Landsat times series, both to monitor forest dynamics and to support wise forest management at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. In the last decade, there has been an acceleration in the development of approaches designed to put the Landsat archive to use towards these causes. Forest disturbance mapping has moved from using individual change-detection algorithms, which implement a single set of decision rules that may not apply well to a range of scenarios, to compiling ensembles of such algorithms. One approach that has greatly reduced disturbance detection error has been to combine individual algorithm outputs in Random Forest (RF) ensembles trained with disturbance reference data, a process called stacking (or secondary classification). Previous research has demonstrated more robust and sensitive detection of disturbance using stacking with both multialgorithm ensembles and multispectral ensembles (which make use of a single algorithm applied to multiple spectral bands). In this paper, we examined several additional dimensions of this problem, including: 1) type of algorithm (represented by processes using one image per year vs. all historical images); 2) spectral band choice (including both the basic Landsat reflectance bands and several popular indices based on those bands); 3) number of algorithm/spectral-band combinations needed; and 4) the value of including both algorithm and spectral band diversity in the ensembles. We found that ensemble performance substantially improved per number of model inputs if those inputs were drawn from a diversity of both algorithms and spectral bands. The best models included inputs from both algorithms, using different variants of shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance. Further disturbance detection improvement may depend upon the development of algorithms which either interrogate SWIR and NIR in new ways or better highlight disturbance signals in the visible wavelengths.},

abstract = {Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\% ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.},

After discussing the problem on a basis combining intuition with some hard, cold facts about the distributions of certain test quantities (or "statistics") a simple and definite procedure is proposed for dividing treatments into distinguishable groups, and for determining that the treatments within some of these groups are different, although there is not enough evidence to say "which is which."

ABSTRACT = {Global Forest Change datasets have the potential to assist countries with national forest measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements. This paper assesses the accuracy of the Global Forest Change data against nationally derived forest change data by comparing the forest loss estimates from the global data with the equivalent data from Guyana for the period 2001&ndash;2017. To perform a meaningful comparison between these two datasets, the initial year 2000 forest state needs first to be matched to the definition of forest land cover appropriate to a local national setting. In Guyana, the default definition of 30\% tree cover overestimates forest area is by 483,000 ha (18.15\%). However, by using a tree canopy cover (i.e., density of tree canopy coverage metric) threshold of 94\%, a close match between the Guyana-MRV non-forest area and the Global Forest Change dataset is achieved with a difference of only 24,210 ha (0.91\%) between the two maps. A complimentary analysis using a two-stage stratified random sampling design showed the 94\% tree canopy cover threshold gave a close correspondence (R2 = 0.98) with the Guyana-MRV data, while the Global Forest Change default setting of 30\% tree canopy cover threshold gave a poorer fit (R2 = 0.91). Having aligned the definitions of forest for the Global Forest Change and the Guyana-MRV products for the year 2000, we show that over the period 2001&ndash;2017 the Global Forest Change data yielded a 99.34\% overall Correspondence with the reference data and a 94.35\% Producer&rsquo;s Accuracy. The Guyana-MRV data yielded a 99.36\% overall Correspondence with the reference data and a 95.94\% Producer&rsquo;s Accuracy. A year-by-year analysis of change from 2001&ndash;2017 shows that in some years, the Global Forest Change dataset underestimates change, and in other years, such as 2016 and 2017, change is detected that is not forest loss or gain, hence the apparent overestimation. The conclusion is that, when suitably calibrated for percentage tree cover, the Global Forest Change datasets give a good first approximation of forest loss (and, probably, gains). However, in countries with large areas of forest cover and low levels of deforestation, these data should not be relied upon to provide a precise annual loss/gain or rate of change estimate for audit purposes without using independent high-quality reference data.},

We estimate that 17\% of tropical moist forests have disappeared since 1990 with a remaining area of 1071 million hectares in 2019, from which 10\% are degraded. Our study underlines the importance of the degradation process in these ecosystems, in particular, as a precursor of deforestation, and in the recent increase in tropical moist forest disturbances (natural and anthropogenic degradation or deforestation). Without a reduction of the present disturbance rates, undisturbed forests will disappear entirely in large tropical humid regions by 2050. Our study suggests that reinforcing actions are needed to prevent the initial degradation that leads to forest clearance in 45\% of the cases.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil{\textquoteright}s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere.

ABSTRACT = {The Bluegrass Region is an area in north-central Kentucky with unique natural and cultural significance, which possesses some of the most fertile soils in the world. Over recent decades, land use and land cover changes have threatened the protection of the unique natural, scenic, and historic resources in this region. In this study, we applied a fragmentation model and a set of landscape metrics together with the satellite-derived USDA Cropland Data Layer to examine the shrinkage and fragmentation of grassland in the Bluegrass Region, Kentucky during 2008&ndash;2018. Our results showed that recent land use change across the Bluegrass Region is characterized by grassland decline, cropland expansion, forest spread, and suburban sprawl. The grassland area decreased by 14.4\%, with an interior (or intact) grassland shrinkage of 5\%, during the study period. Land conversion from grassland to other land cover types has been widespread, with major grassland shrinkage occurring in the west and northeast of the Outer Bluegrass Region and relatively minor grassland conversion in the Inner Bluegrass Region. The number of patches increased from 108,338 to 126,874. The effective mesh size, which represents the degree of landscape fragmentation in a system, decreased from 6629.84 to 1816.58 for the entire Bluegrass Region. This study is the first attempt to quantify recent grassland shrinkage and fragmentation in the Bluegrass Region. Therefore, we call for more intensive monitoring and further conservation efforts to preserve the ecosystem services provided by the Bluegrass Region, which has both local and regional implications for climate mitigation, carbon sequestration, diversity conservation, and culture protection.},

Here, we employed global Landsat analysis-ready data to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements, creating a 30 m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map for the year 2019. The global forest height map was compared to the GEDI validation data (RMSE = 6.6 m; MAE = 4.45 m, R2 = 0.62) and available airborne lidar data (RMSE = 9.07 m; MAE = 6.36 m, R2 = 0.61). The demonstrated integration of GEDI data with time-series optical imagery is expected to enable multidecadal historic analysis and operational forward monitoring of forest height and its dynamics. Such capability is important to support global climate and sustainable development initiatives.}

ABSTRACT = {The multi-decadal Landsat data record is a unique tool for global land cover and land use change analysis. However, the large volume of the Landsat image archive and inconsistent coverage of clear-sky observations hamper land cover monitoring at large geographic extent. Here, we present a consistently processed and temporally aggregated Landsat Analysis Ready Data produced by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery team at the University of Maryland (GLAD ARD) suitable for national to global empirical land cover mapping and change detection. The GLAD ARD represent a 16-day time-series of tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to present, updated annually, and designed for land cover monitoring at global to local scales. A set of tools for multi-temporal data processing and characterization using machine learning provided with GLAD ARD serves as an end-to-end solution for Landsat-based natural resource assessment and monitoring. The GLAD ARD data and tools have been implemented at the national, regional, and global extent for water, forest, and crop mapping. The GLAD ARD data and tools are available at the GLAD website for free access.},

ABSTRACT = {Wildfires constitute the most important natural disturbance of Mediterranean forests, driving vegetation dynamics. Although Mediterranean species have developed ecological post-fire recovery strategies, the impacts of climate change and changes in fire regimes may endanger their resilience capacity. This study aims at assessing post-fire recovery dynamics at different stages in two large fires that occurred in Mediterranean pine forests (Spain) using temporal segmentation of the Landsat time series (1994&ndash;2018). Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) was used to derive trajectory metrics from Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW), sensitive to canopy moisture and structure, and Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA), related to vegetation cover gradients. Different groups of post-fire trajectories were identified through K-means clustering of the Recovery Ratios (RR) from fitted trajectories: continuous recovery, continuous recovery with slope changes, continuous recovery stabilized and non-continuous recovery. The influence of pre-fire conditions, fire severity, topographic variables and post-fire climate on recovery rates for each recovery category at successional stages was analyzed through Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The modeling results indicated that pine forest recovery rates were highly sensitive to post-fire climate in the mid and long-term and to fire severity in the short-term, but less influenced by topographic conditions (adjusted R-squared ranged from 0.58 to 0.88 and from 0.54 to 0.93 for TCA and TCW, respectively). Recovery estimation was assessed through orthophotos, showing a high accuracy (Dice Coefficient ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 and from 0.74 to 0.96 for TCA and TCW, respectively). This study provides new insights into the post-fire recovery dynamics at successional stages and driving factors. The proposed method could be an approach to model the recovery for the Mediterranean areas and help managers in determining which areas may not be able to recover naturally.},

ABSTRACT = {Producing accurate land cover maps is time-consuming and estimating land cover changes between two generated maps is affected by error propagation. The increased availability of analysis-ready Earth Observation (EO) data and the access to big data analytics capabilities on Google Earth Engine (GEE) have opened the opportunities for continuous monitoring of environment changing patterns. This research proposed a framework for analyzing urban land cover change trajectories based on Landsat time series and LandTrendr, a well-known spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm for land-based disturbance and recovery detection. The framework involved the use of baseline land cover maps generated at the beginning and at the end of the considered time interval and proposed a new approach to merge the LandTrendr results using multiple indices for reconstructing dense annual land cover maps within the considered period. A supervised support vector machine (SVM) classification was first performed on the two Landsat scenes, respectively, acquired in 1987 and 2019 over Kigali, Rwanda. The resulting land cover maps were then imported in the GEE platform and used to label the interannual LandTrendr-derived changes. The changes in duration, year, and magnitude of land cover disturbance were derived from six different indices/bands using the LandTrendr algorithm. The interannual change LandTrendr results were then combined using a robust estimation procedure based on principal component analysis (PCA) for reconstructing the annual land cover change maps. The produced yearly land cover maps were assessed using validation data and the GEE-based Area Estimation and Accuracy Assessment (Area2) application. The results were used to study the Kigali&rsquo;s urbanization in the last three decades since 1987. The results illustrated that from 1987 to 1998, the urbanization was characterized by slow development, with less than a 2% annual growth rate. The post-conflict period was characterized by accelerated urbanization, with a 4.5% annual growth rate, particularly from 2004 onwards due to migration flows and investment promotion in the construction industry. The five-year interval analysis from 1990 to 2019 revealed that impervious surfaces increased from 4233.5 to 12116 hectares, with a 3.7% average annual growth rate. The proposed scheme was found to be cost-effective and useful for continuously monitoring the complex urban land cover dynamics, especially in environments with EO data affordability issues, and in data-sparse regions.},

ABSTRACT = {With rapid urbanization in recent decades, more and more urban renewal has taken place in China. Meanwhile, the early developed areas without change have become old towns, which need special attention in future city planning. However, other than field surveys, there is no specific method to identify old towns. To fill this gap, we used time-series image stacks established from Landsat Surface Reflectance Tier 1 data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, facilitated by Global Urban Boundary (GUB), Essential Urban Land Use Categories (EULUC) and Global Artificial Impervious Area (GAIA) data. The LandTrendr change detection algorithm was applied to extract detailed information from 14 band/index trajectories. These features were then used as inputs to two methods of old town identification: statistical thresholding and random forest classification. We assessed these two methods in a rapidly developing large city, Hangzhou, and subsequently obtained overall accuracies of 81.33% and 90.67%, respectively. Red band, NIR band and related indices show higher importance in random forest classification, and the magnitude feature plays an outstanding role. The final map of Hangzhou during the 2000–2018 period shows that the old towns were concentrated in the downtown region near West Lake within the urban boundaries in 2000, and far fewer than the renewed areas. The results could serve as references in the provincial and national planning of future urban developments.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding vegetation disturbance around protected areas (PAs) is critical as it significantly affects the sustainable conservation of wildlife. However, there is a lack of analyses of consistent long-term data on vegetation disturbance. In this study, the LandTrendr algorithm and Google Earth Engine were used to access satellite data and explore the vegetation dynamics history across the Ruaha–Rungwa landscape, Tanzania. We characterized vegetation disturbance patterns and change attributes, including disturbance occurrence trends, rate, and severity, by using each pixel’s normalized burn ratio index time series. Between 2000 and 2019, 36% of the vegetation was significantly disturbed by anthropogenic activities. The results of this study show that the disturbance trends, severity, and patterns are highly variable and strongly depend on the management approaches implemented in the heterogeneous landscape: Ruaha National Park (RNP), Rungwa–Kizigo–Muhesi Game Reserves (RKMGR), and the surrounding zones. The disturbance rates and severity were pronounced and increased toward the edges of the western RKMGR. However, the disturbance in the areas surrounding the RNP was lower. The characterization of the vegetation disturbance over time provides spatial information that is necessary for policy makers, managers, and conservationists to understand the ongoing long-term changes in large PAs.},

ABSTRACT = {The 2019&ndash;2020 Kangaroo Island bushfires in South Australia burned almost half of the island. To understand how to avoid future severe &lsquo;mega-fires&rsquo; and how vegetation may recover from 2019&ndash;2020, we can utilize information from the bulk of historical fires in an area. Landsat time-series of vegetation change provide this opportunity, but there has been little analysis of large numbers of fires to build a landscape-level understanding and quantify drivers in an Australian context. In this study, we built a yearly cloud-free surface reflectance normalized burn ratio (NBR) time-series (1988&ndash;2020) using all available summer Landsat images over Kangaroo Island. Data were collected in Google Earth Engine and fitted with LandTrendr. Burn severity and post-fire recovery were quantified for 47 fires, with a new recovery metric facilitating comparison where fire frequency is high. Variables representing the current burn, fire history, vegetation structure, and topography were related to severity and yearly recovery with random forest and bivariate analysis. Results show that the 2019&ndash;2020 bushfires were the most widespread and severe, followed by 2007&ndash;2008. Vegetation recovers quickly, with NBR stabilizing ten years post-fire on average. Severity is most influenced by fire frequency, vegetation capacity and land use with more severe burns in nature conservation areas with dense vegetation and a history of frequent fires. Influence on recovery varied with time since fire, with initial (year 1&ndash;3) faster recovery observed in areas with less surviving vegetation. Later (year 6&ndash;10) recovery was most influenced by a variable representing burn year and further investigation indicates that precipitation increases in later post-fire years likely facilitated faster recovery. The relative abundance of eucalypt woodlands also has a positive influence on recovery in middle and later years. These results provide valuable information to land managers on Kangaroo Island and in similar environments, who should consider adjusting practices to limit future mega-fire risk and potential ecosystem shifts if severe fires become more frequent with climate change.},

ABSTRACT = {Mapping forest disturbance is crucial for many applications related to decision-making for sustainable forest management. This study identified the effect of illegal amber mining on forest change and accumulated carbon stock across a study area of 8125.5 ha in northern Ukraine. Our method relies on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) implementation of the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) temporal segmentation algorithm of Landsat time-series (LTS) to derive yearly maps of forest disturbance and recovery in areas affected by amber extraction operations. We used virtual reality (VR) 360 interactive panoramic images taken from the sites to attribute four levels of forest disturbance associated with the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) and then calculated the carbon loss. We revealed that illegal amber extraction in Ukraine has been occurring since the middle of the 1990s, yielding 3260 ha of total disturbed area up to 2019. This study indicated that the area of forest disturbance increased dramatically during 2013&ndash;2014, and illegal amber operations persist. As a result, regrowth processes were mapped on only 375 ha of total disturbed area. The results were integrated into the Forest Stewardship Council&reg; (FSC&reg;) quality management system in the region to categorize Forest Management Units (FMUs) conforming to different disturbance rates and taking actions related to their certification status. Moreover, carbon loss evaluation allows the responsible forest management systems to be streamlined and to endorse ecosystem service assessment.},

This research used Landsat time-series data from 1984 to 2015 to examine forest disturbance and recovery in a subtropical region of eastern Zhejiang Province, China, through the LandTrendr algorithm. Field inventory data and high spatial resolution images were used to evaluate the disturbance and recovery results. This research indicates that high producer and user accuracies for both disturbance and recovery classes were obtained and three levels of disturbance and recovery each can be detected. Through incorporation of climate data and disturbance results, drought events also can be successfully detected. More research is needed to incorporate multisource data for detection of forest disturbance types in subtropical regions.},

ABSTRACT = {Tracking cropland change and its spatiotemporal characteristics can provide a scientific basis for assessments of ecological restoration in reclamation areas. In 1998, an ecological restoration project (Converting Farmland to Lake) was launched in Dongting Lake, China, in which original lake areas reclaimed for cropland were converted back to lake or to poplar cultivation areas. This study characterized the resulting long-term (1998&ndash;2018) change patterns using the LandTrendr algorithm with Landsat time-series data derived from the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Of the total cropland affected, ~447.48 km2 was converted to lake and 499.9 km2 was converted to poplar cultivation, with overall accuracies of 87.0% and 83.8%, respectively. The former covered a wider range, mainly distributed in the area surrounding Datong Lake, while the latter was more clustered in North and West Dongting Lake. Our methods based on GEE captured cropland change information efficiently, providing data (raster maps, yearly data, and change attributes) that can assist researchers and managers in gaining a better understanding of environmental influences related to the ongoing conversion efforts in this region.},

ABSTRACT = {A Landsat time series has been recognized as a viable source of information for monitoring and assessing forest disturbances and for continuous reporting on forest dynamics. This study focused on developing automated procedures for detecting disturbances in Mediterranean coppice forests which are characterized by rapid regrowth after a cut. Specifically, new methods specific to Mediterranean coppice forests are needed for mapping clearcut disturbances over time and for estimating related indicators in the context of Sustainable Forest Management and Biodiversity International monitoring frameworks. The aim of this work was to develop a new change detection algorithm for mapping clearcut disturbances in Mediterranean coppice forests with Landsat time series (LTS) using a short time window. Accuracy for the new algorithm, characterized as the Two Thresholds Method (TTM), was evaluated using an independent clearcut reference dataset over a temporal period of the 13 years between 2001 and 2013. TTM was also evaluated against two benchmark approaches: (i) LandTrendr, and (ii) the forest loss category of the Global Forest Change Map. Overall Accuracy for LandTrendr and TTM were greater than 0.94. Meanwhile, smaller accuracies were always obtained for the GFC. In particular, Producer&rsquo;s Accuracy ranged between 0.45 and 0.84 for TTM and between 0.49 and 0.83 for LT, while for the GFC, PA ranged between 0 and 0.38. User&rsquo;s Accuracy ranged between 0.86 and 0.96 for TTM and between 0.73 and 0.91 for LT, while for the GFC UA ranged between 0.19 and 1.00. Moreover, to illustrate the utility of TTM for mapping clearcut disturbances in Mediterranean coppice forests, we applied TTM to a Landsat scene that covered almost the entirety of the Tuscany region in Italy.},

ABSTRACT = {The development and utilization of mining resources are basic requirements for social and economic development. Both open-pit mining and underground mining have impacts on land, ecology, and the environment. Of these, open-pit mining is considered to have the greatest impact due to the drastic changes wrought on the original landform and the disturbance to vegetation. As awareness of environmental protection has grown, land reclamation has been included in the mining process. In this study, we used the Shengli Coalfield in the eastern steppe region of Inner Mongolia to demonstrate a mining and reclamation monitoring process. We combined the Google Earth Engine platform with time series Landsat images and the LandTrendr algorithm to identify and monitor mining disturbances to grassland and land reclamation in open-pit mining areas of the coalfield between 2003 and 2019. Pixel-based trajectories were used to reconstruct the temporal evolution of vegetation, and sequential Landsat archive data were used to achieve accurate measures of disturbances to vegetation. The results show that: (1) the proposed method can be used to determine the years in which vegetation disturbance and recovery occurred with accuracies of 86.53% and 78.57%, respectively; (2) mining in the Shengli mining area resulted in the conversion of 89.98 km2 of land from grassland, water, etc., to barren earth, and only 23.54 km2 was reclaimed, for a reclamation rate of 26.16%; and (3) the method proposed in this paper can achieve fast, efficient identification of surface mining land disturbances and reclamation, and has the potential to be applied to other similar areas.},

abstract = {Substantial land surface greening has been observed globally over the last few decades. This greening has been primarily attributed to climate change and CO2 concentrations, but recent research studies have emphasized the large role of human land use in this process, especially agricultural land abandonment (ALA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term gradual greening of agricultural land can aid in mapping abandoned land across Poland. Trend estimation and temporal segmentation were applied to the 1986–2019 annual Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series to detect periods of long-term greening and to assess its relationship with actual information on ALA. The results show that long-term greening is widespread in Poland (covering up to 60% of its territory), regardless of former and current land uses, most of which has stemmed from modifications within stable land use classes (as they cover 91% of Poland). The highest greening rates and intensities were observed due to conversions from agricultural to non-agricultural land use, which strongly suggests land abandonment and the proceeding succession. However, some proportion of managed agricultural land has also experienced high-intensity greening, and a large proportion of abandoned agricultural land is not greening intensively. Thus, setting an exact greening intensity threshold allowing to clearly distinguish the status of land was not possible. This study also presents the consistency of the Landsat annual time series and its good performance for long-term greening detection, indicating that temporal segmentation may better capture ALA patterns than trend estimation}

abstract = {Much of the world's temperate grasslands have been converted to croplands, yet these trends can reverse in some regions. This is the case for the steppes of northern Kazakhstan, where the breakdown of the Soviet Union led to widespread cropland abandonment, creating restoration opportunities. Understanding when abandonment happened and whether it persists is important for making use of these opportunities. We developed a trajectory-based change detection approach to identify cropland abandonment between 1988 and 2013 and recultivation between 1991 and 2013. Our approach is based on annual time series of cropland probabilities derived from Landsat imagery and resulted in reliable maps (89% overall accuracy), with abandonment being detected more accurately (user's accuracy of 93%) than recultivation (73%). Most of the remaining uncertainty in our maps was due to low image availability during the mid-1990s, leading to abandonment in the 1990s sometimes only being detected in the 2000s. Our results suggest that of the ~4.7 million ha of cropland in our study area in 1985, roughly 40% had been abandoned by 2013. Knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for deeper insights into what drives these dynamics: recultivation after 2007 happened preferentially on those lands that had been abandoned most recently, suggesting that the most productive croplands were abandoned last and recultivated first. Likewise, knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for more precise estimates of the environmental impacts of abandonment (e.g., soil organic carbon sequestration estimated at 16.3 Mt. C compared to 24.0 Mt. C when assuming all abandonment happened right after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, with the uncertainty around emission estimates decreasing by 63%). Overall, our study emphasizes the value of the Landsat archive for understanding agricultural land-use dynamics, and the opportunities of trajectory-based approaches for mapping these dynamics.}

abstract = {Agricultural land abandonment is a common land-use change, making the accurate mapping of both location and timing when agricultural land abandonment occurred important to understand its environmental and social outcomes. However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi-resolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 ± 1%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 ± 3%). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.}

abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Amazon v{\'{a}}rzeas are an important component of the Amazon biome, but anthropic and climatic impacts have been leading to forest loss and interruption of essential ecosystem functions and services. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the capability of the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to characterize changes in v{\'{a}}rzeaforest cover in the Lower Amazon, and to analyze the potential of spectral and temporal attributes to classify forest loss as either natural or anthropogenic. We used a time series of 37 Landsat TM and ETM+ images acquired between 1984 and 2009. We used the LandTrendr algorithm to detect forest cover change and the attributes of "start year", "magnitude", and "duration" of the changes, as well as "NDVI at the end of series". Detection was restricted to areas identified as having forest cover at the start and/or end of the time series. We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the extracted attributes, differentiating between anthropogenic and natural forest loss. Detection reliability was consistently high for change events along the Amazon River channel, but variable for changes within the floodplain. Spectral-temporal trajectories faithfully represented the nature of changes in floodplain forest cover, corroborating field observations. We estimated anthropogenic forest losses to be larger (1.071 ha) than natural losses (884 ha), with a global classification accuracy of 94%. We conclude that the LandTrendr algorithm is a reliable tool for studies of forest dynamics throughout the floodplain.RESUMOAs v{\'{a}}rzeas amaz{\^{o}}nicas s{\~{a}}o um importante componente do bioma Amaz{\^{o}}nico, mas impactos antr{\'{o}}picos e clim{\'{a}}ticos t{\^{e}}m levado {\`{a}} perda florestal e {\`{a}} interrup{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de processos e servi{\c{c}}os ecossist{\^{e}}micos.

abstract = {Monitoring and classifying forest disturbance using Landsat time series has improved greatly over the past decade, with many new algorithms taking advantage of the high-quality, cost free data in the archive. Much of the innovation has been focused on use of sophisticated workflows that consist of a logical sequence of processes and rules, multiple statistical functions, and parameter sets that must be calibrated to accurately classify disturbance. For many algorithms, calibration has been local to areas of interest and the algorithm's classification performance has been good under those circumstances. When applied elsewhere, however, algorithm performance has suffered. An alternative strategy for calibration may be to use the locally tested parameter values in conjunction with a statistical approach (e.g., Random Forests; RF) to align algorithm classification with a reference disturbance dataset, a process we call secondary classification. We tested that strategy here using RF with LandTrendr, an algorithm that runs on one spectral band or index. Disturbance detection using secondary classification was spectral band- or index-dependent, with each spectral dimension providing some unique detections and different error rates. Using secondary classification, we tested whether an integrated multispectral LandTrendr ensemble, with various combinations of the six basic Landsat reflectance bands and seven common spectral indices, improves algorithm performance. Results indicated a substantial reduction in errors relative to secondary classification based on single bands/indices, revealing the importance of a multispectral approach to forest disturbance detection. To explain the importance of specific bands and spectral indices in the multispectral ensemble, we developed a disturbance signal-to-noise metric that clearly highlighted the value of shortwave-infrared reflectance, especially when paired with near-infrared reflectance.}

Using an actual large-scale restoration target of the Atlantic Forest hotspot, we show that our approach can deliver an eightfold increase in cost-effectiveness for biodiversity conservation compared with a baseline of non-systematic restoration. A compromise solution avoids 26\% of the biome’s current extinction debt of 2,864 plant and animal species (an increase of 257\% compared with the baseline). Moreover, this solution sequesters 1 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent (a 105\% increase) while reducing costs by US\$28 billion (a 57\% decrease).

abstract = {One way of analyzing satellite images for land use and land cover change (LULCC) is time series analysis (TSA). Most of the many TSA based LULCC algorithms proposed in the remote sensing community perform well on datasets for which they were designed, but their performance on randomly chosen datasets from across the globe has not been studied. A polyalgorithm combines several basic algorithms, each meant to solve the same problem, producing a strategy that unites the strengths and circumvents the weaknesses of constituent algorithms. The foundation of the proposed TSA based ‘polyalgorithm' for LULCC is three algorithms (BFAST, EWMACD, and LandTrendR), precisely described mathematically, and chosen to be fundamentally distinct from each other in design and in the phenomena they capture. Analysis of results representing success, failure, and parameter sensitivity for each algorithm is presented. For a given pixel, Hausdorff distance is used to compare the distance between the change times (breakpoints) obtained from two different algorithms. Timesync validation data, a dataset that is based on human interpretation of Landsat time series in concert with historical aerial photography, is used for validation. The polyalgorithm yields more accurate results than EWMACD and LandTrendR alone, but counterintuitively not better than BFAST alone. This nascent work will be directly useful in land use and land cover change studies, of interest to terrestrial science research, especially regarding anthropogenic impacts on the environment.},

abstract = {Formal planning and development of what became the first Landsat satellite commenced over 50 years ago in 1967. Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop—justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.}

With nearly 40years of continuous observation – since launch of the first satellite in 1972 – the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century.}

abstract = {New remote sensing data on vegetation cover and restoration opportunities bring hope to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the hottest of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots. Available estimates of remaining vegetation cover in the biome currently range from 11% to 16%. However, our new land-cover map, prepared at the highest resolution ever (5m), reveals a current vegetation cover of 28%, or 32 million hectares (Mha) of native vegetation. Simultaneously, we found 7.2Mha of degraded riparian areas, of which 5.2Mha at least must be restored before 2038 by landowners for legislation compliance. Restoring the existing legal debt could increase native vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest up to 35%. Such effort, if well planned and implemented, could reduce extinction processes by increasing connectivity of vegetation remnants and rising total native cover to above the critical biodiversity threshold established for different taxonomic groups. If undertaken, this process can be adaptive to climate change and boost sustainable development in this most populous biome in Brazil, turning it into a hopespot.}

abstract = {The emergence of vegetation change detection algorithms in the last decade is impressive. But the results still have a lot of noise that needs to be cleaned. And the data cleaning process still uses other landcover mapping results. Besides that, the necessity to generate invariant land use classes is important to know particularly to forest areas. Thinking about that, this paper seeks to create a new form of mapping these invariant areas that can be used to mask noise and as an input on other conservation and restoration studies. The methodology proposed here uses the Google Earth Engine platform and a Random Forest algorithm to classify invariant forest areas using all the image’s collection in the time series at once. The results showed that the new approach performed better than the use of more traditional techniques such as the aggregation of annual land-use and land-cover mappings, with an overall accuracy of 91.7\%. Also, this paper seeks to contribute to the remote sensing community showing after exhaustive testing, good options of variables to use on this type of work.}

abstract = {Abstract The global restoration movement is gaining momentum. International and national leaders are demonstrating unparalleled political will for achieving ambitious targets. However, the knowledge base for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration (FLR) needs further development. Besides application of scientific and local knowledge, a broad understanding of the social, economic, and environmental context in which this knowledge is being applied is also needed. To address knowledge gaps and guide implementation of FLR at local to global scales we propose a knowledge creation agenda that we derive from emerging policy goals. We present a holistic approach that addresses food security, ecosystem services, and livelihoods, and that supports implementation by a wide array of actors from farmers and municipalities to corporations and state agencies. Our knowledge creation agenda is based on six broad policy goals, with several associated knowledge gaps for each goal. We recognize that this agenda is simply a starting point and will surely evolve and become more locally focused as the concept of FLR gains ground and as multiple groups of stakeholders engage in the long-term process of restoring functionality and value to ecosystems and landscapes around the world.},

abstract = {Summary Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed- to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the – many times overlooked – importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden cultivation systems.},

@article{Hemati2021,
abstract = {With uninterrupted space-based data collection since 1972, Landsat plays a key role in systematic monitoring of the Earth's surface, enabled by an extensive and free, radiometrically consistent, global archive of imagery. Governments and international organizations rely on Landsat time series for monitoring and deriving a systematic understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's surface at a spatial scale relevant to management, scientific inquiry, and policy development. In this study, we identify trends in Landsat-informed change detection studies by surveying 50 years of published applications, processing, and change detection methods. Specifically, a representative database was created resulting in 490 relevant journal articles derived from the Web of Science and Scopus. From these articles, we provide a review of recent developments, opportunities, and trends in Landsat change detection studies. The impact of the Landsat free and open data policy in 2008 is evident in the literature as a turning point in the number and nature of change detection studies. Based upon the search terms used and articles included, average number of Landsat images used in studies increased from 10 images before 2008 to 100,000 images in 2020. The 2008 opening of the Landsat archive resulted in a marked increase in the number of images used per study, typically providing the basis for the other trends in evidence. These key trends include an increase in automated processing, use of analysis-ready data (especially those with atmospheric correction), and use of cloud computing platforms, all over increasing large areas. The nature of change methods has evolved from representative bi-temporal pairs to time series of images capturing dynamics and trends, capable of revealing both gradual and abrupt changes. The result also revealed a greater use of nonparametric classifiers for Landsat change detection analysis. Landsat-9, to be launched in September 2021, in combination with the continued operation of Landsat-8 and integration with Sentinel-2, enhances opportunities for improved monitoring of change over increasingly larger areas with greater intra- and interannual frequency.},
